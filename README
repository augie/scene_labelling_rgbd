The code is divided into 2 main folders at top level

1) svm-python-v204/
2) semantic_label_3d/

(1) contains the modules for running SVMStruct inference and learning.
Please check the README files inside that folder for more details.

(2) is a ROS package which contains modules for processing pointclouds
eg segmentation, stitching, feature generation, live classification.
For now, we only support live classification. Check the README inside
that folder for instructions on running live classifier.


INSTALLATION

1) Install ROS Diamondback (Google it)

2) Our code has many dependencies. We have provided scripts to install
many of them on 64 bit machines running Ubuntu. Run install_dependencies.sh
in current folder. Also run semantic_label_3d/installDependencies.sh to
install dependencies for our ROS package.

3) Run make in svm-python-v204/ and semantic_label_3d/.


We have tested our code only on 64 bit machines running Ubuntu and on
Diamondback release of ROS. It has some issues with the latest Electric
release.
